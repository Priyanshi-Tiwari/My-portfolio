If you are a newbie who wants to learn web development or front-end web development, there are three things that are important to learn HTML, CSS and javascript but the first thing you need to understand is how HTML works.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
Sound scary, right? But trust me it’s not. When it comes to learning and understanding html, it is the easiest of all.

To understand what is Html, let’s first understand what is hypertext and markup?
Hypertext: A hypertext is a link which when clicked takes you to another page. A number of interconnected hyperlinks is what creates the world wide web.
Markup: html basically marks up your content with tags to tell the browser and the user how your file is structured. It tells where is paragraph using p tag or header using header tag, it also tells when the text is being bold or italized etc.

To give your webpage the required formatting, HTML uses three main components tags, elements and attributes.

What are tags?
The angle brackets that are used for marking up the content to make it look a certain way are called tags. For example: this is a paragraph tag:<p></p>. All the tags come in pairs, the opening tag and the closing tag. The closing tag is characterised with a “/” symbol. The most commonly used tags are 
Body tag:<body></body>
Head tag:<head></head>
Header tag:<header></header>
Footer tag:<footer></footer>
Heading tag:<h1></h1>
                     <h2></h2>
                      .
                      .
                      .
                      <h6></h6>
Paragraph tag:<p></p>
Section tag: <section></section>
Bold text:<b></b>
Italic text:<i></i>
Etc.

What are elements?
An element is composed of an opening tag, a closing tag and all the content between them.
For example: <h1>some text</h1>
Here <h1> is the opening tag, </h1> is the closing tag and some text is he content between them, put it all together and you get an element.

An HTML file is just a bunch of elements put together which eventually decides the structure of your content.You can also nest an element within another element.
For example:
<body>
<h1>some text</h1>
<p>some text</p>
</body>
Here the p tag and h1 tag are nested within the body tag.

What are attributes?

Now the last thing to learn in html code is attributes. An attribute is an additional information about the element written in the opening tag and it generally comes in name/value pairs(name=”value”)
 The syntax:
<tag attribute=”name”>some text</tag>
Attributes can be used to define height,width,font,color etc of the element.
For Example:
<a href=”www.google.com”> Click here</a>>
Here a is the an anchor tag , href is the attribute that used to define the link of the address and the value between the the quotes is the address of the link.

These three things cover the basics of what of what HTML is. 

A basic Html file looks something like this:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

To cover is up HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your webpage. It tells the browser/user how you want to structure your content by marking it up with suitable tags.

In fact, the page you are seeing right now is an HTML file that your browser has rendered to structure this webpage.
